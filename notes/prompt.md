# Vue bootstrap Project Prompt
We would like you to create a new Vue project with some basic routable views.

## Due Date
Friday March 20th, 2020 at 12:00 PM

## Project top level Requirements
- This does not have to be deployed on the internet
- No back end is required
- `npm run serve` should start a local server where we can view the end result in browser
- Please do this work in a repository
    - Does not have to be public, but we will want access to the repo and not just the final code
    - This is your best opportunity to communicate your building process as it evolves so please make lots of commits and give descriptive commit messages

## Vue Application Requirements
- Must route to two pages
    - Use any routing library you choose
    - Required pages
        - /home
        - /news
- Page Header that shows up on every page
    - This just needs to have a text title. Don't spend time on the design.
- Both pages must display a button that has some non-default text formatting
    - Example: Bold red font.  But as long as you apply some CSS then the requirement is satisfied
    - When you click the button, a message is logged to the console that includes the page you are on


## Submission
Please share a link to a public repo or add me (@jeffisadams) to the list of collaborators.
- Read access is fine
- Please also send an email when this step is completed so we know you are done.
- Do not incur charges to share this repo. I know github is free under most circumstances, but if you encounter a situation where it would not be free, then reach out and we will find an alternative.

## Evaluation
- Structure and clean code is more important than polished looking pages
- Code Structure follows Vue conventions
- Tooling and bootstrapped serve process is successful and starts the page

## Available tools
Feel free to use anything you can find on the internet:
- Tutorials
- Vue / Framework Documentation
- CLI / code tools to bootstrap
    - Either from Vue directly or from third parties
- Me: jeff@tenmilesquare.com
    - We work collaboratively.  If I can save you and hour of research by answering a relatively quick question or clarifying something then please reach out.

## Other general requests
- If you have spent more than 2 hours and have not made substantive progress then please reach out
    - This should take you no more than 5 or 6 hours in total so if progress isn't happening, then please reach out
- Please reference the tools / tutorials you used
    - This just means a top level bibliography with a list of links.
- Please commit early and often.
    - Again, this is the best way for us to see how and why you made the decisions you made.
